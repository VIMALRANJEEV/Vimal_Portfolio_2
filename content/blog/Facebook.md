### The initial plan for data exploration

The plan for data exploration was to first identify the data types of attributes.   
Then identifying the mean, median, minimum, maximum and the IQR of each attribute.   
Late the attributes were visualized using distribution plot, box plot(for identifying outliers) and count plots according to data types of the attributes.

### Actions are taken for data cleaning and feature engineering

The data was cleaning by filling the missing values with the mean of the columns and the outliers were bought to 3rd interquartile values of the columns
