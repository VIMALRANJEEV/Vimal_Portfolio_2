ABOUT THE DATASET

SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object recognition algorithms with minimal requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real-world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.

The dataset consists of 73,257 digits for training and 26,032 digits for testing. It also comes with an additional 531,131 somewhat less difficult samples that can be used as extra training data. It is recommended to use the full dataset (630K images) when evaluating algorithms as it is common practice in the majority of the literature.

ABOUT IMAGE RECOGNITION

Image recognition refers to technologies that identify places, logos, people, objects, buildings, and several other variables in digital images. It may be very easy for humans like you and me to recognise different images, such as images of animals. We can easily recognise the image of a cat and differentiate it from an image of a horse. But it may not be so simple for a computer.

A digital image is an image composed of picture elements, also known as pixels, each with finite, discrete quantities of numeric representation for its intensity or grey level. So the computer sees an image as numerical values of these pixels and in order to recognise a certain image, it has to recognise the patterns and regularities in this numerical data.
