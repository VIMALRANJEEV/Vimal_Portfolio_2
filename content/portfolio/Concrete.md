ABOUT THE DATASET

The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) for a given mixture under a specific age (days) was determined from the laboratory. Data is in raw form (not scaled). The data has 8 quantitative input variables, and 1 quantitative output variable, and 1030 instances (observations).

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

This dataset was provided to me as part of my AIML course. Thanks to my faculty

ABOUT CONCRETE

Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. In the past, lime-based cement binders, such as lime putty, were often used but sometimes with other hydraulic cement, such as a calcium aluminate cement or with Portland cement to form Portland cement concrete (named for its visual resemblance to Portland stone). Many other non-cementitious types of concrete exist with other methods of binding aggregate together, including asphalt concrete with a bitumen binder, which is frequently used for road surfaces, and polymer concretes that use polymers as a binder.
