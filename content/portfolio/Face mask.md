ABOUT THE DATASET

WIDER Face Dataset  
WIDER FACE dataset is a face detection benchmark dataset, of which images are selected from the publicly available WIDER dataset.  
This data has 32,203 images and 393,703 faces are labelled with a high degree of variability in scale, pose and occlusion as depicted in the sample images.

ABOUT IMAGE SEGMENTATION

Image segmentation is a commonly used technique in digital image processing and analysis to partition an image into multiple parts or regions, often based on the characteristics of the pixels in the image. Image segmentation could involve separating foreground from background, or clustering regions of pixels based on similarities in colour or shape. For example, a common application of image segmentation in medical imaging is to detect and label pixels in an image or voxels of a 3D volume that represent a tumour in a patientâ€™s brain or other organs.

Image segmentation involves converting an image into a collection of regions of pixels that are represented by a mask or a labelled image. By dividing an image into segments, you can process only the important segments of the image instead of processing the entire image. \[[More](https://in.mathworks.com/discovery/image-segmentation.html)\]
